# Placement-prediction-system
The "Placement Prediction System" uses machine learning techniques to make precise and fact-based predictions about a studentâ€™s probability of being placed using GUI created using Tkinter.

Language and libraries used:
1. Python
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. TKinter

Model training process, which encompassed the utilization of 
various machine learning algorithms, including 
1. Logistic Regression 
2. K-Nearest Neighbours (knn)
3. Decision tree
4. Random Forest 
5. Gradient Boosting classifier

The evaluation of machine learning algorithms is based on their respective 
accuracy scores. Among the evaluated algorithms, Logistic regression 
outperformed the others, demonstrating a superior accuracy score.
